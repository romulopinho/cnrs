\section{Introduction}

The choice of the stent dimensions is a direct result of the assessment of tracheal stenosis. Hence, when assessing the strictures, it is important to carefully determine their location, length, and degree of narrowing \citep{Boiselle}. The correct assessment, in conjunction with other diagnostic
tools, also aids in determining if the patient is a candidate for surgery or stent implant.

Stenosis assessment and stent choice have also been a topic of interest in the cardiovascular community. \citet{Florez} proposed a graphical model for vascular stent pose simulation. The model represents a deformable cylindrical surface that responds to an energy minimization function controlling its bending and how it is attracted to artery boundaries in image data. \citet{Bemmel} employed level-sets for the segmentation of the stenotic artery and manually chose a healthy section
of the artery as a reference to compute the level of stenosis.

Concomitantly with developments in the search for treatments for tracheal stenosis, Active Contour Models (ACMs, or snakes) and Active Shape Models (ASMs) have been important tools in computer aided diagnoses. The former is used to detect contours in an image by minimising an energy function controlling the bending and stretching of the contour and how it is attracted by image features \citep{Kass}. The latter type of models capture statistical shape variations from a set of training shapes and can be registered to clinical image data by simple adjustment of their parameters.
In addition, a distinctive characteristic of ASMs is that they only generate shapes that resemble those in the training set. This makes them more robust to noise and occlusion in comparison with other deformable models and free-form registration techniques \citep{Cootes}

Having the above concepts in mind, this thesis sets forth a decision support
system that proposes a method for assessment of tracheal stenosis and
prediction of stent length and diameter. The main idea behind this method
is to estimate the shape of the trachea of a patient as if stenosis were not
present. To this end, an ASM built solely with healthy tracheae is registered
to the CT scan of that patient. The expected result is that the registration
yields a shape that matches the healthy areas of the trachea, while at the
same time avoids the influence of the narrowed regions. Since, as mentioned
above, an ASM only generates shapes that resemble those in its training
set, the local geometric variations of the strictures, typical of stenosis, are
avoided.

Despite the motivation to use an ASM with healthy tracheae in order
to avoid the local variations of the stenosis, the strictures may have global
influence on the registration of the ASM to the image. Since variations in
calibre are usually present in the model, the strictures can eventually make
the resulting shape globally much narrower than desired. For this reason, a
novel Robust ASM Fitting procedure, called Fixed Landmarks, is proposed.
The idea behind the Fixed Landmarks is to reinforce the resistance of the
registration to the attraction incurred by the narrowed parts of the trachea.
This is achieved by keeping the parts of the estimated trachea corresponding
to regions with stenosis fixed at each iteration, relative to their location
at the previous iteration. In this way, not only are the narrowed regions
avoided, but the fixed areas incur an extra repelling force that will aid in
the estimation of the healthy tracheal wall over those regions.

When the ASM registration is finished, it is thus expected that the
resulting shape be estimation of the patient’s trachea as if stenosis were
not present. In order to assess the extent and degree of stenosis, however,
it is still necessary to segment the narrowed trachea from the image.
This is achieved using an ACM tailored for this purpose. Using the estimated
healthy trachea as a starting point, the ACM will deform it until the
boundary of the narrowed trachea is completely detected. The internal and
external forces of the ACM were therefore specifically designed to let the
model yield the best possible contour delineation with the lowest possible
shape deformation.

\section{Project Description}

The objective of the proposed project is to develop a solution for the problem of stent choice in the treatment of vascular stenoses and aneurysms. To achieve the desired result, several challenges need to be faced, among them the segmentation of the arterial tree and its surface representation, the construction of a model to predict healthy arteries from images of affected patients, an algorithm for the quantification of stenosis and aneurysms, a model for the choice of stent taking into account arteries' and stents' physical properties, and, finally, a simulation environment for the study of stent placement and blood flow. In the following, each of these aspects is discussed in more detail, and the envisioned solutions in the context of this project proposal are presented.

\subsection{Segmentation of the Arterial Tree}

\subsection{Estimation of Healthy Arteries}

When physicians
assess the stenosis, it is intuitive to imagine that they try to guess
from the available data how the patient’s trachea would appear if the narrowing
were not present. This image of the healthy trachea is the basis to
determine the location, length, and degree of the stricture. The image of the calibre and curvature of the estimated healthy shape also aid in choosing
the type and dimensions of the stent to be used, or even the shape the
trachea should have after a reconstruction surgery.

Inspired by this procedure, the proposed method aims at providing to
the physician the desired healthy shape. This shape not only represents
the necessary visual aid in the diagnostic and pre-operative processes, but
also enables the automatic assessment of the stenosis and suggestion of
patient-specific stent dimensions. The estimation of the healthy shape of
the trachea is obtained thanks to the use of an Active Shape Model of
healthy tracheae and to a new algorithm to register such model to CT
data.

An Active Shape Model (ASM), as defined by \citet{Cootes}, is
a statistical model of shapes whose objective is to capture the geometric
variation present in a set of training shapes. This model is then capable
of generating new shape instances which are constrained by the statistical
variation of the training set, referred to as the allowable shape domain.
As a result, a defining characteristic of ASMs, which is an advantage with
respect to other deformable models, is that they can only generate shapes
that resemble those in the training set.

This characteristic is the motivation to use an ASM of healthy tracheae
to estimate the healthy tracheal shape of a patient with stenosis. Since the
model contains only instances of healthy tracheae, local geometric variations
typical of stenosis cannot be generated. The details of the construction and
use of the proposed ASM are presented in the following.

\section{Applications}

\section{Integration in the Laboratory, Collaborations, Schedule}

\subsection{Laboratory}

My intention of joining the CREATIS group is on the one hand to benefit from their expertise in the several areas correlated to this project proposal. On the other hand, it will be my role to contribute to this expertise by bringing to the lab my own experience with the assessment and stenting of tracheal stenosis and applying it to the cardiovascular domain.

CREATIS have at their disposal an internal computer cluster and also the computation power of the {\bf Centre de Calcul de L'Institut National de Physique Nucléaire et de Physique des Particules (CC-IN2P3)}. These will be invaluable tools for the simulation part of the proposed project. 

Most importantly, CREATIS also profit from a very multidisciplinary nature and strong links with the clinical practice, most notably that of the {\bf h\^opital neuro-cardiologique des Hospices Civiles de Lyon (HCL)} and of the {\bf Centre L\'eon B\'erard (CLB)}. This will give me the opportunity to evaluate the results of the proposed project with real patients and to have immediate feedback from physicians. 

\subsection{Collaborations}

During my PhD in Belgium, I established a very good relationship Prof. Dr. Jan Sijbers, who was my thesis supervisor, in the VisionLab group of the University of Antwerp. The group has large experience with medical image segmentation problems and modelling of cylindrical objects, which could be interesting in the context of this project. I would like to bring the VisionLab and CREATIS together during the course of the proposed project, so that they can benefit from each other's work.

My stay in Belgium also allowed me to get acquainted with the work of Matthieu De Beule, from the Stent Research Unit of the University of Ghent. His thesis was focussed on the design of stents using numerical simulations, on which much of this project would be based. 

I also envision collaborations with the academic and industrial partners of the European Project THROMBUS, the aim of which is to evaluate the efficacy of the use of stents in neurological aneurysms. These partners, including CREATIS, combine expertise in different areas and will certainly be a good source of information for my project.

\subsection{Tentative Schedule}

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:schedule}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:schedule} shows a tentative schedule for the proposed project. The objective in the short term, roughly the first 6 months, is to try to directly apply the statistical model I proposed in my thesis to cases of arterial stenosis and aneurysms. I have reasons to believe that this step tends to be rather straightforward, requiring only few modifications to the original method, if any. The possibly biggest challenge here would be the segmentation and surface modelling of the arteries, which, in the first instance, could be simplified (e.g., not taking bifurcations into account) and accomplished with existing techniques so as to yield acceptable results in a short period of time. 

The following step, to be carried out during the next 18 months, would be the extension of the statistical model with anatomical information about the arterial tree. This would require the interaction with those in the domain of geometrical modelling...

Finally, the remaining 24 months will be dedicated to the stent choice and simulation parts. The starting point of this step will be the stent choice with a generic stent and artery model. In other words, stents' and arteries' physical properties will not be taken into account. In this way, we will be able to at least evaluate if the generic stents computed with use of the statistical model are adequate. Later, blood flow and stent design simulation results will be used to improve the statistical model and, ultimately, the automatic stent choice.
